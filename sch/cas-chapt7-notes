Because the British controlled more North American territory after the Seven Years War, they had to devote more troops and supplies to secure the territories. The British needed more money to support this, so they started levying taxes on the American colonists.

I The Deep Roots of Revolution
Two ideas had taken root in the minds of the American colonists by the mid 18th century (not mutually exclusive): 

1) Republicanism: a just society as one in which all citizens willingly subordinated their private, selfish interests to the common good, going against aristocracy and the monarchs.

2) Radical Whigs: an 18th-century British group who vouched for greater individual liberties, limited government power, and more democratic ideas. Later becomes a political party.


II Mercantilism and Colonial Grievances

Georgia was the only colony to be formally created by Britain.
The British viewed the American colonists as tenants: the colonists should exclusively support Britain (via supply of raw materials, purchase of British exports, etc).

Common Sense pamphlet by Thomas Pain - made to inform the common person of the weaknesses of overseas control from the British

The Navigation Law of 1650 stated that goods going to England must be transported on English ships or ships from the country where the goods came from. Certain colonial goods, like tobacco and sugar, could only be sold to England or other English colonies. It added taxes to goods not carried on English ships.

III The Merits and Menace of Mercantilism

Explain the Colonial view of mercantilism. 
They thought they should have the right to make their own economic decisions, as they resented British laws which forced them to exclusively trade with Britain and pay taxes on everything.  

Sugar Tax was the first tax to raise money for the town, set colonists overboard

Quartering Act - had to provide food and shelter for British soldiers

Describe what is meant  by “deliberately oppressive” and “used” in terms of colonists’ sentiments on mercantilism. 
In the colonists' view, "deliberately oppressive" means that they thought the British government purposely made strict and unfair rules to control and harm their economy. They felt "used" because they believed the British were taking advantage of them, using their resources and trade for Britain's benefit without giving them a fair share.

Were there any benefits for colonists?
Yes. London paid bounties to colonial producers of ship parts. Virginia tobacco planters had a monopoly in the British market. They also benefited from world-class protection from one of the greatest navies in the world at the time.

Benefits for the British? 


IV The Stamp Tax Uproar

Britain incurred a large debt due to the Seven Years War, most of which was created defending the North American colonies. Britain began to look for ways of getting the colonists to pay for this debt.
In 1763, Prime Minister George Grenville ordered the British navy to begin strictly enforcing the Navigation Laws.  He also got Parliament to pass the Stamp Tax the first law ever passed by Parliament to raise tax revenue in the colonies for England. The Sugar Act increased the duty on foreign sugar imported from the West Indies.

The Quartering Act of 1765 required certain colonies to provide food and quarters for British troops.
In 1765, Grenville imposed a stamp tax on the colonies to raise revenues to support the new military force. This stamp tax, known as the Stamp Act, required colonists to use stamped paper or affixing the stamps, certifying payment of tax.


How did the colonists react to these impositions?
 The colonists acted angrily.


V Parliament Forced to Repeal the Stamp Act

Twenty seven delegates from 9 colonies met in New York City for the Stamp Act Congress 1765. The members drew up a statement of their rights and grievances and requested the king and Parliament to repeal the hated legislation. The meeting was largely ignored by England, but it was one step towards unity.

Nonimportation agreements

The Sons of Liberty and Daughters of Liberty took the law into their own hands by enforcing the nonimportation agreements.

The Stamp Act was repealed by Parliament in the year 1766.

Parliament passed the Declaratory Act, which reaffirmed Parliament’s right to bind the colonies “in all cases whatsoever.”
 
VI The Townshend Tea Tax and the Boston Massacre

In 1767, Parliament passed the Townshend Acts.  They put a light import tax on glass, white lead, paper, paint, and tea.
American colonists were rebellious to the new taxes and as a result of these rebellions, the British landed 2 regiments of troops in the colonies in 1768.
On March 5, 1770, a crowd of 60 townspeople attacked 10 redcoats and the redcoats opened fired on the civilians, killing/wounding 11 of them.  The massacre was known as the Boston Massacre.
 
VII The Seditious Committees of Correspondence

Lord North, the prime minister of Britain, was forced to persuade Parliament to repeal the Townshend revenue duties.

Samuel Adams: master propagandist and engineer of rebellion; formed the first local committee of correspondence in Massachusetts.


Committees of Correspondence were created by the American colonies in order to communicate and share information among themselves

 They were organized in the decade before the Revolution when communication between the colonies became essential.

In March of 1773, the Virginia House of Burgesses, the lower house of the Colony of Virginia, proposed that each colonial legislature _______________________ Within just a year, ____________of the colonies had joined.
